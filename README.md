# Circles

![Screenshot](img/circles.png)

Just a simple shape-drawing demo written in GW-BASIC, and rewritten in Python 3 and PyGame.
It simply draws circles of a radius of 50 pixels, in 10-degree increments, 50px from the
center of the screen, choosing a random color from the CGA 16-color palette.  In the PyGame version,
I've tried to annotate it as much as possbible, interleaving the GW-BASIC code in comments alongside 
equivalent Python code.

The GW-BASIC version can be run in DOSBox in GW-BASIC, or in PC-BASIC, a fantastic
interpreter written in Python 3.  The Python version requires PyGame.
